I am a Data Analyst with over 12 years of experience, specializing in data visualization, reporting automation, and dashboard development using SQL, Tableau and Power BI. My expertise lies in extracting actionable insights from large datasets to drive business intelligence, customer analytics, and KPI tracking across sales, marketing, and customer experience teams.

At Fusion Connect, I led the design and implementation of interactive dashboards, consolidated multi-source datasets, and developed performance metrics that improved decision-making and operational efficiency.
